# *IMPORTANT* :: A key part of this assignment is figuring out how to model states
# effectively. We've defined a class `State` to help you think through this, with a
# field called `memory`.
#
# As you implement the different types of search problems below, think about what
# `memory` should contain to enable efficient search!
#   > Check out the docstring for `State` in `util.py` for more details and code.
# Note: It might also be worthwhile to familiarize yourself with the CityMap class 
# and makeTag function in mapUtil.py.
